    <h2>Game Overview</h2>
    <p>The Pirate Game is an activity where players use a worksheet to place a set of symbols and values on a 7x7 grid. The teacher calls out a grid reference in Spanish, and players must match it to their grid, earning points or using special symbols to interact with the game.</p>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>The goal of the game is to have the highest score by the end. Points can be earned, stolen, swapped, or banked, and special symbols have various effects!</p>
  </section>

  <section id="symbols">
    <h2>Symbols and Their Effects</h2>
    <div class="symbol">
      <h3>The Pirate Ship</h3>
      <p>This allows the player to 'rob' someone else's points. The player must raise their hand when they get this symbol to choose who to rob.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="symbol">
      <h3>The Dagger</h3>
      <p>This allows the player to 'kill' someone and wipe their score down to 0. The player must raise their hand when they get this symbol to choose who to kill.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="symbol">
      <h3>The Present</h3>
      <p>This symbol allows the player to give 1000 points to another individual. The player must raise their hand when they get this symbol to choose who to give the points to. A chocolate may also be given to the recipient!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="symbol">
      <h3>Skull and Crossbones</h3>
      <p>This symbol allows the player to wipe out an entire row of the class' points to 0. The row can defend if they use 2 shields or mirrors.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="symbol">
      <h3>Swap Points</h3>
      <p>This symbol allows the player to swap their points with another person’s points. The player must raise their hand to choose the person to swap with.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="symbol">
      <h3>Choose</h3>
      <p>This symbol allows the player to choose the next grid reference to be called out. They must raise their hand to be added to the 'choose next square' list.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="symbol">
      <h3>Shield</h3>
      <p>This symbol allows the player to block any wrongdoing against them. The player can use this once the shield is marked in their worksheet.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="symbol">
      <h3>Mirror</h3>
      <p>This symbol allows the player to mirror any wrongdoing back to the person who did it. It can be used once and must be marked in the mirror section of their worksheet.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="symbol">
      <h3>Bomb</h3>
      <p>If the player gets this symbol, their points will go to 0.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="symbol">
      <h3>x2</h3>
      <p>This symbol doubles the player’s current score.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="symbol">
      <h3>B (Bank)</h3>
      <p>This symbol allows the player to bank their points, making them safe for the rest of the game. They cannot be stolen or wiped out.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="hitlist">
    <h2>Hitlist</h2>
    <p>The "hitlist" is used to track players who have the most points for future robs, kills, and point swaps. It's a fun way to add more competition to the game!</p>
  </section>

  <section id="winning">
    <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
    <p>The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game, including both the banked points and the ongoing score!</p>
